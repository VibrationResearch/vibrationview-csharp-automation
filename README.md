# VibrationVIEW C# Automation

## Overview

This project provides an example window that demonstrates how to use the VibrationVIEW automation API, allowing you to control vibration tests, manage test profiles, collect data, and monitor system status directly from a C# application. It may be used as distributed or as an example to build your own interface to VibrationVIEW.

- Test automation and control
- Data acquisition and analysis
- Window management
- Channel configuration
- Input/output monitoring
- File operations
- Specialized test controls (e.g., sine sweep functions)

This program may be used as distributed or as an example to build your own interface to VibrationVIEW.
